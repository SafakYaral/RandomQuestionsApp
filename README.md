# RandomQuestionsApp
We created an application where the user is presented with 10 random questions pulled from a website. The app shows the user how many questions they answered correctly out of 10, with different questions each time it is opened. The application utilized structures such as web service, MVVM, JsonDecoder, and URLSession.
